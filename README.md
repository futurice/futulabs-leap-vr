# What
This is a fun sandbox demo that demonstrates the capabilities of at least Oculus Rift and Leap Motion. At some point it has also used HTC Vive and Kinect.

# How

## Hardware
First, you need a beefy computer. Second, you need Oculus Rift CV1 (and the headtracking sensors) and Leap Motion. You don't need Oculus touch controllers.

## Software
You need to be running Windows 7+ (we use 10 to develop). The project is currently on Unity version 5.5.3f1.
Open the Main.scene which is the most up to date, the others are a little experimental.

# Who
People that have worked on this project include Joonas Nissinen (dev), Mathias NÃ¸rregaard (dev), Tuomas Ahva (sound) and Niclas Forsman (dev)

# Why
For fun and learning! But more importantly to promote that we know how to build VR stuff, so that we can sell VR projects.
